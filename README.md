## 🎮 About the Game

Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where players manipulate falling Tetrominoes to clear lines and score points. This version of Tetris includes exciting features such as:

- **Multiple Game Modes**:
  - **Quickie Mode**: A fast-paced game for casual players.
  - **Advanced Mode**: A challenging mode with leaderboard integration.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**:
  - Adjustable falling speeds for different difficulty levels.
  - Rotatable Tetrominoes with collision detection.
- **Customization Options**:
  - Change colors for Tetrominoes, borders, and text.
  - Reset settings to default with ease.
- **Leaderboard**:
  - Tracks top scores and player names.
  - Separate leaderboards for Quickie and Advanced modes.

## 🛠️ Features and Highlights

### 1. **Object-Oriented Design**
- The game leverages OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Tetrominoes are represented as objects with properties like shape, position, and color.

### 2. **Data Structures**
- **2D Vectors**: Used to represent the game grid and Tetromino shapes.
- **Vectors of Pairs**: Manage leaderboard entries efficiently.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Sort leaderboard scores dynamically.

### 3. **User Interface**
- **Console-based UI**: Simple yet visually appealing interface with ASCII art and color-coded elements.
- **Interactive Menus**: Navigate through the game modes, customization options, and leaderboard seamlessly.

### 4. **File Handling**
- Persistent storage for leaderboard data using text files.
- Load and save high scores automatically.
